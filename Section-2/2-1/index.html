                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p> Hi, My name is Erik Barker, from a profetional stand point I am very open minded and eager to learn new concepts. 
                I excell in the Math and Science departments the most. I do well with working alone and with a team, in teams I 
                can be a very depenable teamate and leader. I have also been known to bring new ideas to the table. I enjoy solving problems
                and finding new solutions to them, if I dont know something I will do my best to learn in right. As a person I enjoy coding as one
                of my hobbies, it forces me to solve problems, and think about them deeply. I also enjoy helping other people, weather it be with 
                understanding or comprehending code, or with the struggles that arise in the workplace in general. 
                </p>
